Usage :
	transport help -- will print this page

    transport move <path> [index]
        <path>  path to the configuration file
        <index> optional index within the configuration file

e.g: configuration file (JSON formatted)
    - single source to a single target

    {"source":{"provider":"http","url":"https://cdn.wsform.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/agreement.csv"}
        "target":{"provider":"sqlite3","path":"transport-demo.sqlite","table":"agreement"}
    }

    - single source to multiple targets
    {
        "source":{"provider":"http","url":"https://cdn.wsform.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/agreement.csv"},
        "target":[
